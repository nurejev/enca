# CA Doc — Conditional Access Baseline Tools

A browser-based toolset for a Microsoft Entra Conditional Access baseline: **document it, analyse it, check it against best practice, back it up and redeploy it** — from one page, with an interactive Entra sign-in and nothing to install.

It started as a web successor to the idPowerToys CA documenter and grew into eleven tools. Everything runs **100% in the browser** as a static site: no backend, no database, no telemetry, and no policy data ever leaves the user's session. All Microsoft Graph calls go straight from the browser to `graph.microsoft.com` with a delegated token.

**Live:** https://cadoc.limon-it.nl · **Demo without sign-in:** https://cadoc.limon-it.nl/?demo=1

## What's in it

| Tool | What it does | Writes? |
|---|---|---|
| 🗂 **Policies** | Every policy as cards, a list, or a settings matrix — grouped by persona from the CA number (CA000–099 Global, CA100–199 Admins, … CA1100–1199 E-Admins). Expand a policy to inspect its dependencies (auth strengths, named locations, groups with their first members, terms of use). | no |
| 📄 **Create documentation** | Select policies (or take all) and generate shareable documentation: **Word**, **PDF**, **PNG**, or a **PNG bundle**. Exports are neutral — they carry the connected tenant's branding, not Limon-IT's. | no |
| 🔍 **Gap analyse** | Users × policies impact matrix: which policies apply to whom, who bypasses one through an exclusion (and why), whether that bypass is covered elsewhere, and who gets no MFA at all. Filter by group or user type, then export the filtered set as a standalone HTML report. | no |
| 🛡 **Best-practice & bypass checks** | The baseline against known CA bypasses and the Swiss-cheese layered-defense model: MFA coverage, FOCI token sharing, resource-exclusion scope leaks, CA-immune resources, device-registration bypass, grant-operator weaknesses, legacy auth, known bypass apps, guest auth strength, break-glass coverage — plus a persona × control coverage matrix. Exports to Markdown. | no |
| 🚪 **Exclusion analyzer** | Every exclusion in every policy — users, groups (expanded to their members), directory roles, guest/external types, applications, named locations, device platforms — grouped by exclusion set, with an exclusion × policy matrix and an effective-user × policy matrix. Exports to CSV and Markdown. | no |
| 🧬 **Baseline Policies** | Matches the tenant against the bundled Limon-IT baseline catalog (**R26.6 / v3.x**, 99 policies) on the CA number — the stable identity in the naming convention — and compares versions segment by segment. Every policy lands in one bucket: up to date, outdated (with the upgrade path, e.g. `v1.0 → v1.0.1`), newer than baseline, missing, or not in the baseline. Exports a Markdown gap report and hands off to Import. | no |
| 📘 **MS Learn checks** | Policies against exclusions, limitations and upcoming behaviour changes documented on learn.microsoft.com: missing break-glass exclusions, token-protection limits, Teams Rooms / Surface Hub impact, required app exclusions, control retirements. Each finding links to its source page. Mechanically fixable findings carry a **Fix** button that builds a *new* policy from the affected one with the documented adjustment applied — version bumped, state Off — collected in a **Suggested fixes** tab and downloadable as JSON or one zip. Nothing is written to the tenant — except in a recognised **baseline tenant**, where an **Apply in tenant** action can create the replacements (Off) and delete the originals, behind an explicit confirmation. | no* |
| 🗄 **Backup (JSON)** | Raw Graph JSON of the selected policies in one timestamped zip — including their **dependencies** (auth strengths, named locations, terms of use with the actual PDF, and the groups they assign). | no |
| 👥 **Assign groups** | Replace, add to, or reset the include/exclude persona groups of selected policies. Missing persona groups are created as role-assignable security groups via Graph. | **yes** |
| 🎚 **Set Policy state** | Switch selected policies between On, Report-only and Off. | **yes** |
| 📥 **Import** | Restore a backup (zip or folder): dependencies first, policies always imported **Off**, matched on CA number + version so existing policies are updated rather than duplicated, and include-assignments remapped onto the target tenant's persona groups. Produces a Markdown change report. | **yes** |

The writing actions are always behind an explicit review step and request their write scopes on demand (incremental consent) — signing in never grants them.

## Design notes

- **Graph beta endpoint**, so the newest policy properties are covered — the ones the old documenter misses: authentication flows (device code / auth transfer), insider risk, agent ID risk, token protection / secure sign-in session, Global Secure Access filtering profiles, authentication contexts and workload identities.
- **Persona-aware throughout.** Policies, the coverage matrix and the checks all group by the same CA-number ranges, so a baseline built on the persona convention reads as one picture instead of a flat list.
- **Baseline tenants.** In a staging tenant where the baseline sits Off, the checks treat a deployed-but-disabled policy as *"deployed but Off"* (`○`) rather than a missing control, and skip non-persona policies.
- **No PowerShell.** Everything that used to be a script — the impact matrix, group assignment, group creation, state changes, import — is a Graph call from the browser.
- **Light and dark.** Follows the device by default; the header button cycles Auto → Light → Dark. Exports are always captured in light theme.
- **No build step.** Vanilla JS, self-hosted libraries, GitHub Pages serves the repo as-is.

## Setup — steps for you

### 1. Create the Entra app registration (one-time)

**Option A — script (recommended):**

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Applications -Scope CurrentUser -RequiredVersion 2.25.0   # once, pinned
./New-CaDocAppRegistration.ps1
```

Re-runs: pass `-AppObjectId <object-id>` (shown in the summary output) to target the exact registration instead of matching by display name.

Reuses your current Graph session if connected (otherwise signs in interactively), creates/updates the multi-tenant SPA registration with both redirect URIs and the delegated permissions, grants admin consent in your tenant, and writes the client ID into `js/authConfig.js` automatically.

**Option B — portal:**

1. [Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) → **Identity → Applications → App registrations → New registration**
2. Name: `CA Doc (Limon-IT)`
3. Supported account types: **Accounts in any organizational directory (multi-tenant)**
4. Redirect URI: platform **Single-page application (SPA)** → `https://cadoc.limon-it.nl`
5. After creation, under **Authentication → Single-page application**, also add `http://localhost:8080` (local development)
6. **API permissions → Add a permission → Microsoft Graph → Delegated:**
   - `Policy.Read.All`
   - `Directory.Read.All`
   Then click **Grant admin consent** for your own tenant.
7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into [`js/authConfig.js`](js/authConfig.js) (`clientId`).

No client secret needed — it's a public SPA using PKCE.

### 2. Create the GitHub repo and push

```bash
cd cadoc
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "CA Doc v1"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/cadoc.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

Repo → **Settings → Pages** → Source: **Deploy from a branch** → branch `main`, folder `/ (root)` → Save.
The `CNAME` file (`cadoc.limon-it.nl`) is already in the repo, so the custom domain is picked up automatically.

### 4. DNS record at your registrar

Add a CNAME record for `limon-it.nl`:

| Type  | Name    | Value                       |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------|
| CNAME | `cadoc` | `<your-account>.github.io.` |

Back in repo → Settings → Pages: confirm the custom domain shows `cadoc.limon-it.nl`, wait for the certificate, then tick **Enforce HTTPS**.

### 5. Test

- Local: `cd cadoc && python3 -m http.server 8080` → http://localhost:8080 (sign-in works because of the localhost redirect URI). Or open `?demo=1` for sample data without any setup.
- Production: https://cadoc.limon-it.nl

### 6. Customer tenants (multi-tenant consent)

An admin of each customer tenant must consent once. Send them this URL (replace `CLIENT_ID`):

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/adminconsent?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://cadoc.limon-it.nl
```

After consent, anyone in that tenant with permission to read CA policies (e.g. Security Reader/Global Reader) can sign in and document their policies.

## Project structure

Every JS file is an IIFE assigned to one global — no modules, no bundler, no build step. Load order is the order of the `<script>` tags in `index.html`.

```
index.html            app shell: login, tools home, every tool screen, modals
css/app.css           Limon-IT theme + light/dark palettes
js/authConfig.js      clientId + scopes  ← the only file you must edit
js/labels.js          friendly names for Graph enums / well-known IDs
js/graph.js           MSAL sign-in, policy fetch (Graph beta), GUID→name resolver
js/model.js           raw policy → view model (incl. the newest CA settings)
js/render.js          card / list / settings-matrix rendering + persona grouping
js/analyze.js         users x policies impact engine  (Gap analyse)
js/gapcheck.js        best-practice & bypass checks + persona x control matrix
js/exclusions.js      exclusion collection, group expansion, matrices, CSV/MD
js/baselineData.js    the Limon-IT baseline catalog (R26.6 / v3.x)
js/baseline.js        tenant vs baseline matching, versioning and gap report
js/mslearn.js         MS Learn documented exclusion & limitation checks
js/assign.js          persona group assignment (writes)
js/groupTemplates.js  persona group definitions used when creating groups
js/import.js          backup import: dependencies first, persona remapping (writes)
js/export.js          Word / PDF / PNG / PNG-bundle export + JSON backup zip
js/app.js             wiring: screens, toolbars, theme, permissions, tool state
js/demo.js            sample policies for ?demo=1
vendor/               msal-browser, html-to-image, jsPDF, JSZip (self-hosted)
CNAME                 cadoc.limon-it.nl (GitHub Pages custom domain)
```

## Permissions

Base scopes, consented once per tenant, both **read-only delegated**:

| Scope | Why |
|---|---|
| `Policy.Read.All` | Read CA policies, named locations, authentication strengths and contexts |
| `Directory.Read.All` | Resolve user / group / role / service-principal GUIDs to display names and expand group memberships — without it every export shows raw IDs |

Requested **on demand** (incremental consent) only when a tool needs them:

| Scope | Tool |
|---|---|
| `Agreement.Read.All` | Backup — terms-of-use agreements and their PDFs |
| `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess` | Assign groups, Set Policy state, Import, MS Learn *Apply in tenant* |
| `Application.Read.All` | Import — required by Graph to create policies with app conditions |
| `Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod` | Import — create authentication strengths |
| `Group.ReadWrite.All` | Assign groups — create missing persona groups |
| `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory` | Assign groups — create those groups as role-assignable |

The signed-in user needs a reader role (Security Reader / Global Reader) for the read-only tools, and a role that can edit Conditional Access for the three writing tools. The permission overview on the tools home page shows the live status of each scope in the current session.

## Security

- **No backend.** A static site on GitHub Pages. Policy data is never stored, proxied or logged — it exists only in the browser tab.
- **Sign-in** uses MSAL with the authorization code flow and PKCE, no client secret. Tokens live in `sessionStorage` and are gone when the tab closes.
- **Tokens are only ever attached to `graph.microsoft.com`** — the hostname is validated before every request.
- **A meta Content-Security-Policy** restricts scripts to same-origin and network calls to `graph.microsoft.com` / `login.microsoftonline.com`. (GitHub Pages cannot send CSP headers, and `frame-ancestors` is not enforceable from a meta tag.)
- **All JavaScript libraries are self-hosted** in `vendor/` — nothing loads from a third-party CDN at runtime.
- **Exports are generated locally** and carry the connected tenant's branding, not Limon-IT's.

## Notes

- Uses the Graph **beta** endpoint so the newest policy properties (insiderRiskLevels, agentIdRiskLevels, authenticationFlows, secureSignInSession / token protection, globalSecureAccessFilteringProfile) are included.
- Unknown or newly added policy properties are surfaced rather than silently dropped, so a new CA feature shows up in the documentation before the tool explicitly supports it.
- GUIDs that can't be resolved (e.g. deleted objects) are shown as raw IDs rather than hidden.

## Credits & thanks

Three community projects shaped CA Doc, and all three deserve the credit:

- **[idPowerToys](https://github.com/merill/idPowerToys)** — by **Merill Fernando**. The Conditional Access documenter that started all of this: the idea that a CA baseline should be readable as a document rather than clicked through in the portal. CA Doc is the web successor to that documenter, extended to the newest CA settings.
- **[Conditional Access Impact Matrix](https://github.com/jasperbaes/Conditional-Access-Impact-Matrix)** — by **Jasper Baes**. The users × policies impact model behind the **Gap analyse** tool: working out which policies actually apply to a given user, who bypasses a policy through an exclusion, and whether that bypass is covered somewhere else.
- **[CA Policy Analyzer](https://github.com/Jhope188/ca-policy-analyzer)** — by **jhope188**. The inspiration for the **Best-practice & bypass checks** and **MS Learn checks** tools: best-practice and known-bypass checks laid out against the Swiss-cheese layered-defense model.

All are independently reimplemented here in browser-side JavaScript against Microsoft Graph — no code was copied.

Thanks also to the Conditional Access community whose baselines CA Doc is designed to compare against: **Kenneth van Surksum**, **Joey Verlinden**, and **Claus Jespersen** for the Zero Trust persona framework.

Inspired by the Conditional Access documenter in [idPowerToys](https://github.com/merill/idPowerToys) by Merill Fernando (MIT). CA Doc is an independent from-scratch implementation.

The **MS Learn checks** tool (`js/mslearn.js`) is an independent vanilla-JS implementation of the documented-exclusion check set from [ca-policy-analyzer](https://github.com/Jhope188/ca-policy-analyzer); the checks themselves encode guidance published on learn.microsoft.com (each finding links to its source page).

The **Best-practice & bypass checks** tool (`js/gapcheck.js`) is likewise an independent reimplementation of that project's analyzer check set.
