// ======================================================================
// PROMOTION QUEUE — what is on the beta channel and not yet in production.
//
// Rendered in Help, and ONLY on a non-production host, so a customer on
// enca.limon-it.nl never sees a list of things they do not have.
//
// WHY THIS IS HAND-MAINTAINED. The app is static files in a browser: it
// cannot read git, diff two branches, or know what main contains. So this
// list is written by whoever makes the change — the same discipline as
// js/changelog.js, and the same failure mode if it is skipped: a stale list
// is worse than none, because it will be trusted.
//
// HOUSEKEEPING, every time a change lands on beta:
//   * add it to an existing item if it belongs to one, or open a new item
//   * put the beta builds it spans in `builds`
//   * when it reaches production, delete the item and bump `productionBuild`
//
// `n` is a stable hand-assigned number so it can be referred to out loud —
// "push number 3 to main". Numbers are NOT reused after an item ships;
// the next new item takes the next free number.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE. Roadmap cards, changelog entries and this file
// itself are documentation, not promotable changes: they describe the work
// rather than being it, and a row saying "one roadmap card" buries the rows
// that matter under things nobody decides about separately. They are never
// queued — they simply travel with whatever promotion happens next, which is
// why a port copies index.html's roadmap and Help along with the code.
//
// ONE ITEM PER CHANGE. Only things that must ship together share a number —
// a fix and the feature it fixes, or two edits that are meaningless apart.
// Unrelated work bundled under one number cannot be promoted separately, which
// is the whole point of numbering it: "push 19" has to mean one decision, not
// three that happened to be written on the same day.
