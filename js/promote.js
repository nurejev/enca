// ======================================================================
// PROMOTION QUEUE — what is on the beta channel and not yet in production.
//
// Rendered in Help, and ONLY on a non-production host, so a customer on
// enca.limon-it.nl never sees a list of things they do not have.
//
// WHY THIS IS HAND-MAINTAINED. The app is static files in a browser: it
// cannot read git, diff two branches, or know what main contains. So this
// list is written by whoever makes the change — the same discipline as
// js/changelog.js, and the same failure mode if it is skipped: a stale list
// is worse than none, because it will be trusted.
//
// HOUSEKEEPING, every time a change lands on beta:
//   * add it to an existing item if it belongs to one, or open a new item
//   * put the beta builds it spans in `builds`
//
// PROMOTING AN ITEM — all four, or the two channels start disagreeing:
//   1. delete the item here and bump `productionBuild`
//   2. update the roadmap card ON MAIN: `live · build NNN`
//   3. update the SAME card ON BETA: `live · beta NNNNN · production NNN`
//   4. add the changelog entry on both channels
//
// Step 3 is the one that gets missed, because the port is finished and working
// by then. Each channel carries its own copy of index.html, so promoting only
// touches main's roadmap — beta's card goes on claiming the work is beta-only.
// On 2026-08-17 EIGHT cards had drifted that way: R27 read "live · beta 25115"
// while it had been in production since 283, so the roadmap said beta-only and
// the queue, correctly, showed no gap at all. Two sources of truth, one of them
// updated. R07, R08, R09, R10, R29, R30 and R31 were in the same state.
//
// A card that says "live · beta NNNNN" with NO production clause therefore
// means one of two things, and only one of them is right: the tool is genuinely
// beta-only (R05 today, whose tool has not been promoted), or somebody skipped
// step 3. Write "beta NNNNN · production NNN" — never "build 250xx", which uses
// production wording for a five-digit beta number and reads as a release to
// anybody who does not know the two series apart.
//
// `n` is a stable hand-assigned number so it can be referred to out loud —
// "push number 3 to main". Numbers are NOT reused after an item ships;
// the next new item takes the next free number.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE. Roadmap cards, changelog entries and this file
// itself are documentation, not promotable changes: they describe the work
// rather than being it, and a row saying "one roadmap card" buries the rows
// that matter under things nobody decides about separately. They are never
// queued — they simply travel with whatever promotion happens next, which is
// why a port copies index.html's roadmap and Help along with the code.
//
// ONE ITEM PER CHANGE. Only things that must ship together share a number —
// a fix and the feature it fixes, or two edits that are meaningless apart.
// Unrelated work bundled under one number cannot be promoted separately, which
// is the whole point of numbering it: "push 19" has to mean one decision, not
// three that happened to be written on the same day.
// ======================================================================
// `betaBuild` USED TO LIVE HERE and has been removed on purpose: this site's
// own version is not a judgement call, it is APP_BUILD.label, and the header
// now reads it from there. Hand-maintaining it meant it could disagree with
// the footer of the same page — which it did, printing v1.0.250-beta.112 while
// the app computed v1.0.251-beta.12. Only `productionBuild` stays by hand,
// because the app genuinely cannot know what the other channel is running.

Per-policy targeting resolved on real members (transitive groups, roles, exclusions), the cross-policy UNION compared with P1/P2 seats matched on service plans, risk-based policies flagged as the P2 obligation, plus the why-the-gap-exists explanation and the mitigation options with trade-offs. 25136: the gap is NAMED — targeted users without the licence assigned are listed by UPN (screen + export), disabled accounts flagged as cleanup; the P2 half always renders, stating when nothing creates an obligation. 25137: the list lives in a searchable pop-out with a to-license / cleanup / resource breakdown on the card, and 🏷 Check mailbox types (MailboxSettings.Read, on demand) labels shared/room/equipment accounts as never licensed — and where the delegated read is denied, classifies the refusal (unlicensed account + existing mailbox = likely shared/resource); per-policy Gap column shows which policy drags unlicensed users in; admin-accounts groups (several) can be excluded — type-ahead picker, per-group chips, union of transitive members, exclusion stated in result + export.
